This program uses 6 command-line arguments for user input as my professor said that doing so would yield
bonus points.
The array element next to '-m' is used as message.
The array element (expected to be an integer) next to '-w' is used as width.
The array element (expected to be an integer) next to '-h' is used as height.
This program works fine with every width and height integer input (in range of the Java Primitive Type - Integer) other
than -2147483648. On entry of the previously stated number, the program would state the error
as 'the value cannot be traced' instead of 'Invalid entry'.
